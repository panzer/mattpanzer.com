Their goal is to make the outdoors more accessible for Boston's growing population. Their old website was bland, generic, and was confusing to navigate. Our mission was to fix that.",

      text: "As part of Scout, a student-led design studio, I developed a completely new ticketing frontend. I worked alongside two other computer science students and two design students to make a beautiful website. Our team handled all aspects of development, from frontend to backend. Our designers reimagined the brand and created wireframes which morphed into beautiful interfaces.",

      text: "My prior experience in web design and development were minimal, so this was an excellent opportunity for me to expand my knowledge. I learned Node and React from scratch and put them to use quickly. In addition, our team collaboration required many git branches at a time, so I became much more comfortable with rebasing, merging, and properly structuring commits.",
