Our design featured large colorful paddles to play notes on. This project was extremly interesting because it opened my eyes to the importance of designing for the intended user.",

Calculating the length needed for certain tones required the use of physics formulas and a bit of manual tuning. For creating the frame, we carefully measured and planned our resources as to stay within our budget.",
