Daniel Shiffman, a professor at NYU, inspired this small project. His ML work on his Youtube channel, "The Coding Train" is truely fascinating and well suited for CS students looking to expand their knowledge of ML.',

With the introduction of a Javascript friendly version of Tensorflow, I put together this demonstration to show that ML is at its core a function estimation problem.",
